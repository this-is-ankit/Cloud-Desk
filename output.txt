I have applied the revised `sanitizeElement` and `sanitizeWhiteboardElement` functions to both `frontend/src/components/WhiteboardPanel.jsx` and `backend/src/server.js`.

This change now explicitly sets the `width` and `height` of `freedraw` elements to `1` if they are reported as `0` or non-finite. This is a workaround to provide Excalidraw with a minimal bounding box, which might be necessary if Excalidraw's rendering logic struggles with `0` dimensions even when `points` data is available.

Now, please test the application thoroughly:
*   Start a new session. Draw on the whiteboard. End the session.
*   Start a *brand new session* (without restarting the backend server). Verify if the whiteboard starts empty.
*   Start a session, draw on the whiteboard, *close the browser*, then *reopen the browser* and join the same session. Verify if the drawings persist.
*   Start a session, draw, then *restart the backend server*, and join the same session. Verify if the drawings persist.

This set of tests should confirm the full persistence functionality and hopefully resolve the "dot mark" issue by providing Excalidraw with explicit, minimal dimensions for `freedraw` elements.

Please provide any console logs if there are new issues.
